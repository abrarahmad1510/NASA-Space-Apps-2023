# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge

In a citizen science initiative designed to combat unconscious gender bias within space exploration, participants engage with a modified Implicit Association Test (IAT). This established psychological tool, developed by Harvard's Project Implicit, measures the strength of association between concepts, particularly implicit attitudes and beliefs. Here, the IAT focuses on uncovering unconscious biases related to gender and space exploration. Following the initial assessment, participants are exposed to educational videos sourced from the reputable CSA/NASA Open Science Image and Multimedia Center. These carefully curated videos aim to positively influence participants' unconscious biases. To quantify any shifts in attitudes, participants retake the IAT after viewing the educational materials. By comparing pre- and post-test results, the project seeks to measure the effectiveness of the educational intervention in reducing unconscious gender bias. This project offers a two-pronged benefit.  Firstly, it fosters individual growth by providing participants with valuable insights into their own potential unconscious biases. Secondly, it empowers agencies like NASA/CSA by providing valuable data to identify the most effective educational strategies for promoting positive gender associations with space exploration, ultimately leading to a more inclusive future in the field.
